  <br/>
  <i>An Ethereum wallet built for SMS (instead of the internet)</i>
  <br/>

## Why Do We Need This?

Wallets currently are all built for the internet age. We assume you have access to the internet. This means it's impossible to do anything with web3 while you are off the internet. With Sesame you can send transactions on your favorite networks over SMS!
